## Goal
Our goal for this project was to use the acceleramator data from the micro:bit to analyze a user's punches as they follow along with provided instructions
and provide feedback about their form and accuracy based on the data gathered.

## Problem-solving approach
### Sensors
We used two micro:bits and their accompanying acceleramators to measure the movement over time of a user's arm and wrist through space.
